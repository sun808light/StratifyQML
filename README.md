# StratifyLabs UI

StratifyLabs UI is a QML UI framework inspired by Twitter Bootstrap.  The goal is to provide easy-to-use, customizable QML building blocks that follow the Twitter Bootstrap look and feel including responsive elements that look great on any screen.

# Contributors Welcome

StratifyLabs UI is released under the ASL 2.0.  If you are willing to release contributions under this license and would like to contribute, please let me know.

# Version 2.0 is Almost Ready

Version 1.0 got the ball rolling but version 2.0 is a huge improvement. Much of the API is the same, but under the hood big changes have been made to make customizing and stying objects easier and more intuitive.

## Porting to 2.0
